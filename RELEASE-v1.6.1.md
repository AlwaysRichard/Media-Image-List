# Release Notes - AP Media Image List v1.6.1

**Release Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Type:** Image Display Enhancement  
**Compatibility:** WordPress 5.9+ | PHP 7.4+

## 🖼️ What's New

### Enhanced Image Sizing System
We've completely redesigned how images are displayed to give you precise control over image presentation:

- **Three distinct sizing modes** with proper aspect ratio maintenance
- **No more image elongation** - all images display correctly regardless of their original dimensions
- **Smart column width adjustment** - layout adapts automatically to the selected size
- **Improved CSS specificity** - overrides WordPress inline styles that were causing sizing issues

## ✨ Image Size Options

### 🔲 Thumbnail Mode (`size="thumbnail"`)
- **Display:** 140×140px cropped square
- **Behavior:** Crops images to fill the entire square area
- **Perfect for:** Consistent grid layouts, catalog browsing
- **Result:** Uniform appearance across all images

### 📐 Small Mode (`size="small"` or `size="medium"`)
- **Display:** 140×140px contained  
- **Behavior:** Complete image fits within bounds, maintains aspect ratio
- **Perfect for:** Compact viewing while seeing the entire image
- **Result:** Full image visibility in minimal space

### 🔍 Large Mode (`size="large"` or `size="full"`)
- **Display:** 300×300px contained
- **Behavior:** Complete image fits within bounds, maintains aspect ratio
- **Perfect for:** Detailed examination and quality assessment  
- **Result:** Clear, detailed view for photo editing decisions

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Fixed Image Distortion Issues
- **Before:** Images could appear elongated when using non-thumbnail sizes
- **After:** All images maintain proper aspect ratios regardless of size setting
- **Solution:** Proper CSS constraints with `object-fit` and `!important` declarations

### Dynamic Layout Adjustment
- **Thumbnail/Small:** 190px column width for compact layout
- **Large:** 320px column width to accommodate larger images
- **Responsive:** Layout adjusts automatically based on your size selection

### Enhanced CSS Specificity
- Added `!important` declarations to override WordPress inline styles
- Prevents WordPress from adding conflicting width/height attributes
- Ensures consistent sizing across all WordPress themes

## 🔄 Migration Notes

This is a **fully backward-compatible update**:

- ✅ All existing shortcodes continue to work unchanged
- ✅ No database modifications required
- ✅ All EXIF, category editing, and AJAX functionality preserved
- ✅ Existing `size` attribute values work better than before

## 📋 Usage Examples

```php
// Uniform grid with cropped squares
[media_image_list size="thumbnail"]

// Compact view showing complete images  
[media_image_list size="small"]

// Detailed view for photo review
[media_image_list size="large"]

// Combined with other options
[media_image_list size="large" per_page="25" orderby="date"]
```

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
