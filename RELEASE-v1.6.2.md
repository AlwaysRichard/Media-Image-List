**Type:** Feature Enhancement & Bug Fixes  
**Compatibility:** WordPress 5.9+ | PHP 7.4+

## 🎉 What's New

### 📖 Inline Post Preview
The biggest addition in v1.6.2 is the new **post preview feature** that lets you read full post content without leaving the media list:

- **Click any post title** → Opens a beautiful modal overlay with the complete post

- **Multiple close options** → ×button, click overlay, or press Escape key

### 🔧 Enhanced EXIF Popup Interaction
We've completely fixed and improved the EXIF popup click-to-pin functionality:

- **Proper toggle behavior** → Click once to pin, click again to unpin
- **Visual consistency** → Reliable switching between hover and locked modes
- **Smart switching** → Click different images to move the pin automatically
- **Improved event handling** → No more conflicts or unexpected behavior

## ✨ Key Benefits

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

### EXIF Popup Locking (Major Fix)
- **Issue:** Clicking images didn't properly lock/unlock EXIF popups
- **Cause:** Event handler conflicts and improper state management  
- **Fix:** Completely rewrote click event logic with proper toggle mechanism
- **Result:** Reliable click-to-pin/unpin behavior that works every time

### Post Title Click Behavior
- **Issue:** Clicking post titles either did nothing or caused unwanted page scrolling
- **Cause:** Missing event prevention and conflicting event listeners
- **Fix:** Added proper `preventDefault()` and consolidated JavaScript initialization
- **Result:** Smooth modal opening without any page navigation side effects

### JavaScript Event Conflicts
- **Issue:** Multiple `DOMContentLoaded` listeners causing timing issues
- **Cause:** Fragmented JavaScript initialization across different features
- **Fix:** Consolidated all functionality into single initialization event
- **Result:** Faster, more reliable feature initialization

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Enhanced Event Handling
- **Event delegation** → Properly handles dynamically created elements
- **Conflict prevention** → Removed duplicate event listeners
- **Better bubbling control** → Strategic use of `stopPropagation()`
- **Consolidated initialization** → All features initialize together

### Improved AJAX Implementation

- **Error handling** → User-friendly error messages for failed requests
- **Content processing** → Full WordPress content filter application
- **Performance optimization** → Efficient post content delivery

### Better CSS Architecture
- **Modal styling** → Professional overlay design with proper z-indexing
- **Mobile responsiveness** → Optimized for all screen sizes
- **Visual consistency** → Matches WordPress admin design patterns
- **Accessibility** → Proper focus management and keyboard navigation

## 🎮 User Experience Enhancements

### Post Preview Modal
```
Click post title → Modal opens with:
├── Header: Post title + × close button
├── Metadata: Date, author, status info  
└── Content: Full formatted post content (scrollable)

Close via:
├── × button in header
├── Click outside modal
└── Press Escape key
```

### EXIF Popup Interaction
```
Hover image → EXIF popup appears
Click image → Popup locks open (stays visible)
Click same image again → Popup unlocks (back to hover mode)
Click different image → Pin moves to new image
Click elsewhere → All pins removed
```

## 🔄 Migration Notes
