# Release Notes - AP Media Image List v1.6.0

**Release Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Type:** Major UI Enhancement  
**Compatibility:** WordPress 5.9+ | PHP 7.4+

## 🎉 What's New

### Compact 2-Column Layout
We've completely redesigned the interface for a cleaner, more efficient user experience:

- **Removed the third column** - no more wide tables taking up screen space
- **Inline category editor** - the editor now appears directly within the second column
- **"Edit Categories" button** - click to show/hide the category editor on demand
- **Automatic updates** - category display refreshes immediately after saving

## ✨ Key Improvements

### 📱 Better Mobile Experience
- Reduced table width makes the plugin much more mobile-friendly
- No horizontal scrolling on smaller screens
- Cleaner interface works better on tablets and phones

### 🎯 Improved User Experience
- **One editor at a time** - opening a new editor automatically closes others
- **Visual feedback** - button text changes to "Hide Editor" when editor is visible
- **Seamless interaction** - categories update in real-time without page refresh
- **Space efficient** - more content visible on screen at once

### 🔧 Technical Enhancements
- Streamlined HTML structure with fewer DOM elements
- Optimized CSS for better performance
- Enhanced JavaScript for smoother interactions
- Maintained all existing functionality while improving the interface

## 🔄 Migration Notes

This is a **non-breaking update** - all existing shortcodes and functionality remain the same:

- `[media_image_list]` continues to work exactly as before
- All shortcode attributes remain unchanged
- EXIF popups, search, and AJAX saving work identically
- User permissions and security remain the same
